parabolic antenna: it is an antenna that uses a parabolic reflector, a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves.

Funcutions of PARABOLIC ANTENA: DIRECT BROADCAST TV, MICROWAVE LINKS, SATALITE COMM., RADIO ASTRONOMY

POLARSITION ERROR: An error in a radio direction finder bearing or the course indicated by a radiobeacon because of a change in the polarization of the radio waves between the transmitter and the receiver on being reflected and refracted from the ionosphere

RANGE: The maximum distance at which a radar set is ordinarily effective in detecting objects.

Azimuth: The azimuth is the angle formed between a reference direction  and a line from the observer to a point of interest projected on the same plane as the reference direction orthogonal to the zenith.

TRUE BEARING :The True Bearing of a radar target is the angle between the true north and a line pointed directly at the target. This angle is measured in the horizontal plane and in a clockwise direction from true north.

Pulse Jitter : Pulse jitter is the deviation from true periodicity of a presumably periodic signal, often in 
relation to a reference clock signal.

Pulse Squitter: Squitter refers to random pulses, pulse-pairs and other non-solicited messages used in various aviation radio systems' signal maintenance

PEAK POWER: The peak power is the maximum power that the power supply can sustain for a short time and is 
sometimes called the peak surge power.

RADAR mile in DME : distance measuring equipment (DME) is a radio navigation technology that measures the slant 
range (distance) between an aircraft and a ground station by timing the propagation delay of radio 
signals in the frequency band between 960 and 1215 megahertz (MHz)

PRT(Pulse repitation Freq): it is internal beetween start of one pulse to start of another

DOPPLER EFFECT: iF EITHER SOURCE OF OSCALLIATION OR OBSERVER OF OSCILLATION IS IN MOTION, AN APPARANT SHIFT IN FREQ.

THREESOLD DETECTION: IF RECIVER OUTPUT IS NOT SUFFICENT LEVEL TO CROSS THRESHOLD, ONLY NOISE IS SAID TO BE PRESENT

THERMAL NOISE: NOISE GENERATED BY THERMAL MOTION OF THE CONDUCTION ELECTRON IN RECIVER INPUT STAGES CALLED

DWELL TIMW: DURATION THAT THE TARGET REMAINS IN RADAR'S BEAM DURING EACH SCAN IS KNOWN AS 

BLIND SPEED: VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM IN MTI RADAR. WE CAN EXPLAIN AS RELATIVE VELOCITIES AT WHICH THE MTI RESPONCE IS ZERO

DUCTING: INCREASED BENDING THAT AFFECTS RADAR PERFOMANCE IN SOME SITUATION 

DUTY CYCLE = PRF * PULSE WIDTH, REST TIME: Interval beetw. pulses, PULSE WIDTH: Duration of Pulse

PRF: PRF is the number of pulses transmitted per second & is equal to inverse of PRT, prf = 1/prt
